In class programming:1. Follow the instruction below and then report how the performance changed.(apply all at once)Convolutional input layer, 32 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function.Dropout layer at 20%.Convolutional layer, 32 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function.Max Pool layer with size 2×2.Convolutional layer, 64 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function.Dropout layer at 20%.Convolutional layer, 64 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function.Max Pool layer with size 2×2.Convolutional layer, 128feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function.Dropout layer at 20%.Convolutional layer,128 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function.Max Pool layer with size 2×2.Flatten layer.Dropout layer at 20%.Fully connected layer with 1024units and a rectifier activation function.Dropout layerat 20%.Fully connected layer with 512units and a rectifier activation function.Dropoutlayer at 20%.Fully connected output layer with 10 units and a softmax activation functionDid the performance change?2. Visualize the graphand losswith TensorBoard3. predict the first 4 image of the test data. Then, print the actual label for those 4 images (label means the probability associated with them) to check if the model predicted correctly or not
